Reggie is a little IRC bot that watches for perl-style "s/match/replace/" in chat and performs the actual regex replace (using Ruby's regex) on the previous line and prints the result.

Prepend 'n' exclamation marks before the "s/" to make reggie replace the 'n'th last line you said (ignores the lines of others). 'n' is limited to the @max_bangs instance variable in reggie.rb.

Reggie handles /me (ACTION) lines correctly.
